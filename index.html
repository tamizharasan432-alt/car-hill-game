* Use an HTML `<canvas>` for rendering. No external libraries or assets.
* Implement simple physics: gravity, ground collision, wheel rotation, basic suspension (springy effect), friction, and torque for acceleration and braking.
* Terrain: procedurally generated 2D hills using a seeded algorithm (Perlin-like or sine + randomness). Provide a fixed seed so results are reproducible.
* Controls:
   * Keyboard: Right arrow / D = accelerate; Left arrow / A = brake/reverse; Space = flip/reset.
   * Touch: show two on-screen semi-transparent buttons for left and right when on mobile.
* Car: body and two wheels. Wheels should rotate visually with movement and react to slopes (tilt the car to match chassis angle).
* Gameplay:
   * Score by distance traveled. Display current distance and best distance (persist best in `localStorage`).
   * Reset or respawn when car flips upside-down for more than 2 seconds or falls off screen.
   * Smooth camera that follows the car horizontally.
* UI: Start screen with “Play” button, in-game HUD (distance, best), and a “Restart” button. Include simple instructions.
* Code quality:
   * Well-commented, modular functions, clear variable names.
   * Include a short README comment at top describing controls and how to run.
   * Keep file size modest. Avoid heavy computation each frame.
* Compatibility: Runs in modern desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
* Bonus (optional if simple): add collectible stars on hills that increase score.
Two tiny examples (illustrative only):
* Controls example: `Right = accelerate`, `Left = brake`.
* Seed example: `seed = 12345 → same terrain each run`.
Output format:
* Return only the full `.html` file content inside a single code block. No extra text.
